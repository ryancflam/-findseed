Jock villagers are obsessed with sports, talking frequently about their physical appearance and sporting progress and occasionally gossip. They brag quite a bit, usually about working out. They would encourage the player when given tasks and other things. Stereotypically, they are also not very smart, incessantly confusing themselves - calling the brain \"the Brian\", saying they are in a \"punch\" instead of pinch and failing to even grasp the concept of the game 'rock, paper, scissors'. They rarely talk about fashion, although they are somewhat similar to snooty villagers. They are the brother-like characters in the game, giving pep talks to the player and appearing competitive towards them and other villagers when they partake in town events."

They have the deepest voice of all the characters, and many of them appear to be glaring. They usually spend a small amount of their day in their houses, and most of the day out. They can seem self-centred at first glance, and often enjoy gossiping about lifestyles of other villagers, making them snobby as well as grouchy. They will act protective of the player when the player becomes friends with them and they will seem to disagree with most of the things that other villagers say."

They are generally friendly and hospitable when interacting with the player and other villagers, they are fairly confident in themselves and their lifestyle. Once you become good friends with a lazy villager, they will tell you their made-up stories usually relating to the player, like in dreams. Other times they will not tell you their stories because they fear you would not like them. They do not take insults most of the time but sometimes they can, though they are very friendly and open minded. They also tend to dramatise when sick, and they often pronounce 'medicine' as 'bedicine'. They will also sometimes make suggestive phrases to the player."

They are portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, acting sophisticated and thinking highly of themselves, and will also occasionally flirt with the player. In the game, the first campsite visitor will always be a smug villager."

They also appear slightly obsessive with cleanliness and hygiene - a trait also found in peppy villagers. They don't, however, appear to show any concern for their physical appearance, making them happy with what they have. They are the mother-like characters in the town, appearing friendly, sweet, and hospitable towards the player and other villagers. They like to use French expressions too. They rarely, if at all, get angry and tend to take insults and disappointment personally, but will apologise even though they may not have done anything. They also seem to enjoy cooking and will often ask the player about food."

However, this doesn't prevent them from making the occasional scathing comment. Snooty villagers usually have exotic or upper-class names, or names relating to high-value items and gemstones, making them easy to distinguish when talking to villagers around town."

They speak with gruff, accented voices, similar to the deep voices cranky villagers use, in reference to their \"tough\" attitudes. As a result of this, they are seen as a sort of tomboy, as they occasionally talk about enjoying fighting, and express an interest in participating in 'turf wars'. Sisterly villagers, despite this violent exterior, are kind and empathetic deep down and may act like an older sister when befriended; hence the name 'sisterly'."
