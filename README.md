A *(mostly)* Minecraft-centred Discord bot, [!findseed](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=771403225840222238&permissions=473196598&scope=bot) provides not only convenient Minecraft speedrunning tools for use in Discord such as `!blindtravel`, `!educatedtravel`, and `!triangulation`, but also a lot of random commands and utility features like `!flipcoin`, `!randomnumber`, `!flightinfo`, `!covid`, `!weather`, etc.

**Main Command Categories** (excluding miscellaneous commands):

Miscellaneous features also include **Conversion Tools**, **Animal Crossing**, along with various, less significant commands, which can be accessed via `!miscellaneous`.

There are **Unprompted Messages** that trigger funny bot responses (disabled by default; enable with `!umenable`) such as "f", "hmmm", "I'm !findseed"—see `!unpromptedmessages`.

The bot also attempts to remove any scam links which can be seen in `!scamurls` (enabled by default; disable with `!spdisable`).
