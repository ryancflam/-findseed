A *(mostly)* Minecraft-centred Discord bot, [!findseed](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=771403225840222238&permissions=473196598&scope=bot) provides not only convenient Minecraft speedrunning tools for use in Discord such as `!blindtravel`, `!educatedtravel`, and `!triangulation`, but also a lot of random commands and utility features like `!flipcoin`, `!randomnumber`, `!flightinfo`, `!covid`, `!weather`, etc.

**Main Command Categories** (excluding miscellaneous commands):

- **Chat Games** (`!akinator`, `!battleship`, `!uno`...)

- **General** (`!avatar`, `!msgbotowner`, `!poll`...)

- **Utility** (`!article`, `!wiki`, `!date`...)

Miscellaneous features also include **Conversion Tools**, **Animal Crossing**, along with various, less significant commands, which can be accessed via `!miscellaneous`.

There are **Unprompted Messages** that trigger funny bot responses (disabled by default; enable with `!umenable`) such as "f", "hmmm", "I'm !findseed"—see `!unpromptedmessages`.

The bot also attempts to remove any scam links which can be seen in `!scamurls` (enabled by default; disable with `!spdisable`).

### Other Notes

!findseed does not store any personal data or personally identifying information including usernames, IP addresses, and email addresses. Discord user IDs and server IDs are stored, however, only to record the preferences of the bot's users and servers. The data recorded are in no way used maliciously, personally, or financially—as with anything else with regard to this bot. ~~I can barely write good code let alone hack and steal user data...~~

Users may be subject to being blocked from interacting with the bot in any way if found excessively spamming commands or using them in a malicious or exploitative manner.
