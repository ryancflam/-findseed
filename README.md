A *(mostly)* Minecraft-centred bot, !findseed provides not only Minecraft speedrunning tools such as `!blindtravel`, `!educatedtravel`, and `!triangulation`, but also a lot of random commands and utility features like `!flipcoin`, `!randomnumber`, `!flightinfo`, `!covid`, `!weather`, etc.

**Main Command Categories** (excluding miscellaneous commands):

- **Chat Games** (`!akinator`, `!battleship`, `!uno`...)
- **Cryptocurrency** (`!btcaddr`, `!btcnetwork`, `!cryptoprice`...)
- **General** (`!avatar`, `!msgbotowner`, `!poll`...)
- **Minecraft** (`!findseed`, `!speedrunwr`, `!bartersim`...)
- **Moderation** (`!ban`, `!kick`, `!prune`...)
- **Random Stuff** (`!8ball`, `!randomchoice`, `!trumpthinks`...)
- **Utility** (`!article`, `!wiki`, `!date`...)

Miscellaneous features also include **Conversion Tools**, **Animal Crossing**, and various insignificant commands, which can be accessed via `!miscellaneous`. **Unprompted Messages** that trigger funny bot responses (which are disabled by default) include "hmmmmm" and "I'm !findseed".
